# RigidBodyDynamics

RigidBodyDynamics implements various rigid body dynamics and kinematics algorithms.

## Design features

Some of the key design features of this package are:

* pure Julia implementation, enabling seamless support for e.g. automatic differentiation using [ForwardDiff.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl) and symbolic dynamics using [SymPy.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/SymPy.jl).
* easy creation and modification of general rigid body mechanisms.
* basic parsing of and writing to the [URDF](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf) file format.
* extensive checks that verify that coordinate systems match before computation, with the goal of making reference frame mistakes impossible
* flexible caching of intermediate results to prevent doing double work
* fairly small codebase and few dependencies
* singularity-free rotation parameterizations

## Functionality

Current functionality of RigidBodyDynamics.jl includes:

* kinematics/transforming points and free vectors from one coordinate system to another
* transforming wrenches, momenta (spatial force vectors) and twists and their derivatives (spatial motion vectors) from one coordinate system to another
* relative twists/spatial accelerations between bodies
* kinetic/potential energy
* center of mass
* geometric/basic/spatial Jacobians
* momentum
* momentum matrix
* momentum rate bias (= momentum matrix time derivative multiplied by joint velocity vector)
* mass matrix (composite rigid body algorithm)
* inverse dynamics (recursive Newton-Euler)
* dynamics
* simulation, either using an off-the-shelf ODE integrator or using an included custom Munthe-Kaas integrator that properly handles second-order ODEs defined on a manifold.

Closed-loop systems (parallel mechanisms) are supported, with optional Baumgarte stabilization of the loop joint constraints. Support for contact is very limited (possibly subject to major changes in the future), implemented using penalty methods.

## Installation

### Installing Julia

We recommend installing Julia using `juliaup` — see [Download Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/). To install the latest Julia version, run this in your terminal:
```
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh
```

!!! warning "Please do not use the version of "Julia" shipped by unix package managers (e.g., `apt-get` or `brew`)"
    Many unix package managers ship broken and/or significantly out of date versions of Julia.

!!! note "Compatibility with Julia v0.6"
    Version 0.7 of RigidBodyDynamics.jl is the last to support Julia 0.6.

### Installing RigidBodyDynamics

To install the latest tagged release of RigidBodyDynamics, start Julia and enter `Pkg` mode by pressing `]`. Then simply run

```julia
add RigidBodyDynamics
```

To use the latest master version and work on the bleeding edge (generally, not recommended), instead run

```julia
add RigidBodyDynamics#master
```

A third option is to clone the repository (to the directory printed by `julia -e 'import Pkg; println(Pkg.devdir())'`):

```julia
dev RigidBodyDynamics
```
